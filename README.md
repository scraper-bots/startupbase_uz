## 6. Tech vs Non-Tech Analysis

### Finding: Tech Startups Dominate But Aren't More Mature

![Tech vs Non-Tech](charts/08_tech_vs_nontech.png)

**Tech Industries:** 856 startups (63.4%)
- Average Maturity Score: 2.41

**Non-Tech Industries:** 495 startups (36.6%)
- Average Maturity Score: 2.37

**Key Observation:** Despite representing 63% of the ecosystem, tech startups show only marginally higher maturity (2.41 vs 2.37), suggesting:
1. Tech sector is more accessible to start (lower barriers) but not easier to scale
2. Non-tech startups that do launch are equally capable of reaching growth stages
3. Capital doesn't preferentially flow to tech - investors are sector-agnostic or cautious

#### Actionable Insights:

**For Investors:**
- **Diversification:** Non-tech startups (36.6%) are overlooked but show similar maturity - consider balanced portfolio
- **Tech Saturation:** 63% in tech means higher competition - non-tech may offer better valuations
- **Thesis:** Consider sector-specific funds (AgriTech, GreenTech) given non-tech resilience

**For Founders:**
- **Non-Tech Viability:** Don't feel pressured to be "tech" - 495 successful non-tech startups prove the path
- **Hybrid Models:** Combine traditional industries with tech enablement (e.g., AgriTech, PropTech)
- **Market Reality:** Tech doesn't guarantee funding or success - focus on solving real problems

**For Policymakers:**
- Support non-tech innovation (manufacturing, agriculture, services) equally - they scale just as well
- Avoid over-indexing on "tech for tech's sake" - support problem-solving regardless of sector
- Create non-tech accelerators (e.g., fashion tech, food tech, construction tech)

## 7. Actionable Insights

### For Investors

#### Strategic Opportunities

1. **Series A Gap Arbitrage**
   - **Insight:** 379 seed-stage startups vs. 93 at Early Stage A = 75% drop-off
   - **Action:** Position as Series A specialist - less competition, more negotiating power
   - **Target:** $2-5M ticket sizes for startups with $500K+ ARR and clear path to $5M ARR

2. **Sector Focus Recommendations**
   - **High Conviction:** SaaS (219), EdTech (215), AI & ML (124) - proven volume
   - **Emerging Alpha:** Cybersecurity (21), Blockchain (20), GreenTech (23) - less crowded
   - **Contrarian:** Non-tech (495 startups) - similar maturity, better valuations

3. **Geographic Strategy**
   - **Core:** Tashkent (76.4%) - where deals happen
   - **Tactical:** Regional startups with Tashkent expansion plans - lower entry valuation
   - **International:** 85% of growth-stage exits likely require international expansion - build cross-border networks

4. **Portfolio Construction**
   - **Allocate:** 60% tech, 40% non-tech (mirrors ecosystem but favors overlooked non-tech)
   - **Stage Mix:** 20% Seed, 50% Early A, 30% Series A+ (target the gap)
   - **Follow-On:** Reserve 50% of fund for follow-ons - critical given local capital scarcity

#### Red Flags

- Startups in oversaturated spaces (SaaS, EdTech) without clear differentiation
- Regional startups without credible Tashkent go-to-market plan
- Pre-revenue startups seeking >$500K (misaligned with ecosystem maturity)
- Founder teams with no international exposure (limits exit opportunities)

### For Founders

#### Strategic Playbook

1. **Differentiation in Crowded Markets**
   - **Problem:** SaaS (219) and EdTech (215) are saturated
   - **Solution A:** Vertical specialization (e.g., SaaS for healthcare, EdTech for vocational training)
   - **Solution B:** Regulatory moat (industries requiring licenses/certifications)
   - **Solution C:** International-first strategy (avoid local competition entirely)

2. **Navigating the Series A Valley**
   - **Timeline:** Assume 18-24 months from seed to Series A opportunity
   - **Milestones:** Hit $500K ARR minimum before seeking Series A
   - **Relationships:** Start Series A conversations at $200K ARR (12-18 months early)
   - **Alternatives:** Revenue-based financing, strategic partnerships, grants

3. **Location Strategy**
   - **Tashkent Imperative:** If B2B, must have Tashkent presence (customers + talent)
   - **Regional Advantage:** If consumer-focused, regional launch can test before scaling
   - **Remote-First:** For international markets, location matters less - optimize for talent

4. **Ecosystem Engagement**
   - **Join StartupBase.uz:** Only 11.5% are members - easy visibility
   - **Enter Competitions:** Only 0.7% participated - low-hanging fruit for PR
   - **Case Studies:** Offer to be featured - builds credibility in zero-verification environment

5. **Funding Milestones**

   | Stage | Typical Raise | Key Metrics | Timeline |
   |-------|--------------|-------------|----------|
   | Idea | $0-50K | POC, 10 early adopters | 0-6 months |
   | Pre-Seed | $50-150K | MVP, 100 users, early revenue | 6-12 months |
   | Seed | $150-500K | PMF, $50K+ ARR, 1,000+ users | 12-24 months |
   | Early A | $500K-2M | $500K+ ARR, clear CAC/LTV | 24-36 months |
   | Series A | $2-5M | $2M+ ARR, proven scalability | 36-48 months |
